# helloworld

A trivial haskell program created using:
```
stack new-template helloworld -p "category:Example"
```

Then some minor modifications to helloworld.cabal so we
reference the proper github location and updating
LICENSE to MIT and finally adding .gitignore.

Additional edits while following the instructions from
Chapter 13 "Building Projects" in
[Haskell Programming from first principles](http://haskellbook.com/)
